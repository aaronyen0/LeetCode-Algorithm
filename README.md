# LeetCode-Algorithm

## It's my practice on Leetcode Algorithm
- most of my code was written in C
- some was written in Java, C#, python

## naming rule
- Basic Rule: **No{subject_num: 3d}_v{version_num: 2d} subject_name.{extension_name: str}**
    - subject_num:
        - length of the subject_num is 3:
            - number's length < 3: (30 -> 030), (1 -> 001)
            - number's length > 3: (1111 -> A11), (1206 -> B06)
    - version_num: 
        - version_num denote the version of my answer, you may find all versions in a file
        - length of the version_num is 2
        
    - extension_name: 
        - c, java, py, cs, ...
    
    - example: 
        - **NoA39_v02 Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon.c**
    
- if the answer is inefficient
    - add prefix: inefficient
    
- if the answer is not totally true
    - add prefix: incorrect

- if the answer is very bad
    - add prefix: bad
    
- if the subject is about some important concept
    - add topic prefix: ex: DP(dynamic programming), ...
